# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Capitalize all month letters in date displays throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the date formatting function in `frontend/src/lib/pstDate.ts` to return month names in uppercase (e.g., 'JANUARY', 'FEBRUARY', 'MARCH')

**User-visible outcome:** All dates displayed in the app will show months in uppercase letters (e.g., 'JANUARY 15, 2025' instead of 'January 15, 2025') across Dashboard, History, Log, and Analytics screens.
